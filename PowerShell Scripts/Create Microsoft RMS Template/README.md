<b>What Does This Script Do?</b>

When enabling the ability to transmit encrypted email with Microsoft Purview Message Encryption, you must choose an RMS (Rights Management Service) template. In legacy tenants this feature is not always visible. 

This script installs the required PowerShell module, connects to a tenant, and enables the RMS template. If you are trying to setup Microsoft Message Encryption and are stuck, this script may help solve your problem.
