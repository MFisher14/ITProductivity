This script is used to setup the groups and add the users for the Breach Secure Now / PII Protect Platform. It is an unsigned script, so don't forget to run the:
    
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

before running the script. The easiest way to download and run the file is by following the instructions below:

Click on this link
Right-Click on the page

Save the file as a .ps1 file in a directory that you want to run it from. (I typically do the C: drive for convenience)

Press ENTER
Type Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
Press ENTER
Approve all prompts
Type ./BreachSecureNowAzureADSetup.ps1

You will have to sign-in as an administrator.
